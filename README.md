HTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist certification holders will possess technical competency in the ethical hacking and penetration testing domains at an intermediate level. They will be able to spot security issues and identify avenues of exploitation that may not be immediately apparent from searching for CVEs or known exploit PoCs. They can also think outside the box, chain multiple vulnerabilities to showcase maximum impact, and actionably help organizations remediate vulnerabilities through commercial-grade pentesting reports.
**CBBH**     | Certified Bug Bounty Hunter                       | HTB Certified Bug Bounty Hunter (HTB CBBH) is a highly hands-on certification that assesses the candidates‚Äô bug bounty hunting and web application pentesting skills. HTB Certified Bug Bounty Hunter certification holders will possess technical competency in the bug bounty hunting and web application penetration testing domains at an intermediate level. They will be able to spot security issues and identify avenues of exploitation that may not be immediately apparent from searching for CVEs or known exploit PoCs. They can also think outside the box, chain multiple vulnerabilities to showcase maximum impact, and actionably help developers remediate vulnerabilities through commercial-grade bug reports.
**CDSA**     | Certified Defensive Security Analyst              | HTB Certified Defensive Security Analyst (HTB CDSA) is a highly hands-on certification that assesses the candidates‚Äô security analysis, SOC operations, and incident handling skills.
